<h2>International places I loved to travel to:</h2>
<p>I went to Paris on multiple trips. I even brought my mom with me once, but she didn't enjoy the city of love.</p><br>
<p>Italy! I only got to go to Rome, but there's so much more in Italty I'd love to see.</p><br>
<p>Spain, I was lucky enough to travel to many different parts of Spain.</p><br>
<p>I've been to every country in the United Kingdom except for Wales. Which includes England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.</p><br>
<p>Ireland! It's a must see.</p><br>
<p>I have family in Sweden, and I have visited them often.</p><br>
<p>China is someplace that was so beautiful to go go to, and many delicious things to eat here.</p><br>
<p>Mexico is a great place to get some sand, sun, and eat yummy foods.</p><br>
